In today's digital age, having an accessible and well-structured historical website isessential for preserving and sharing cultural heritage. A dedicated website on national heroes likeDr. Jose Rizal serves as a central hub for students, educators, researchers, and the general publicto access important historical information, including biographies, key events, literary works, andvisual archives. With the increasing reliance on digital platforms, it is crucial to ensure thathistorical resources are presented in a simple, responsive, and engaging format to enhance userexperience and promote national awareness.Despite the importance of digital history, many educational and cultural websites stillstruggle with outdated designs, poor navigation, and lack of responsiveness. Some platforms relyon complex content management systems that require technical expertise to maintain, whileothers lack structured content, making it difficult to locate accurate historical informationefficiently. Poorly designed websites can lead to misinformation, reduced accessibility, anddiminished engagement with historical narratives (Dela Cruz & Morales, 2022).Developing a structured and user-friendly historical website is crucial in addressing thesechallenges. A well-organized digital archive enhances accessibility, provides reliable historical data, and improves learning experiences for students and researchers. By using a lightweight andefficient framework like W3.CSS, this project ensures a responsive design that works seamlesslyacross various devices, promoting inclusivity and wider reach (Baltazar et al., 2024)
